# Streamlit Secrets Configuration Example
# 
# For local development:
# 1. Copy this file to secrets.toml (without .example)
# 2. Replace the placeholder with your actual OpenAI API key
# 3. The secrets.toml file is automatically ignored by git (.gitignore)
#
# For Streamlit Cloud:
# 1. Go to your app settings in Streamlit Cloud
# 2. Click "Edit secrets" 
# 3. Paste the content below (with your actual key) into the secrets editor
#
# Note: You can also enter your API key directly in the app's sidebar input field,
# which works immediately without any configuration.

[secrets]
# Your OpenAI API key (starts with "sk-")
# Get your key from: https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys
OPENAI_API_KEY = "sk-proj-YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"

# Alternative: If your key gets truncated in Streamlit Cloud, split it into two parts:
# OPENAI_API_KEY_PART1 = "sk-proj-first-part-of-your-key-here"
# OPENAI_API_KEY_PART2 = "second-part-of-your-key-here"
